You silenced the doubters, the naysayers, even that prick Obama, everyone who thought you couldn’t pull it off, that you were dead in the water. They were wrong, and you were right. Isn’t that how it always goes?<br><br>You took command of the economic crises plaguing the West, and came out a winner. You spoke to the millions of Americans whose voices went unheard for so long, and now you are primed to be a transformative figure in American history. Most consequential of all, Democrats have retaken the House, by enough of a margin to convince the DINOs that you really are onto something. You now have the opportunity to deliver on your grand promises, and to you goes the delight of choosing how to prioritize them.<br><br> You can put your name on a beautiful healthcare bill to provide coverage to all Americans; become the people’s champion with another round of stimulus spending; codify your foreign policy doctrine as the national norm; or lead the fight to move America forward and legalize gay marriage. All this and more is yours, Mr. President - if only you keep the faith, and stay in the fight, for another glorious term.

Moreover, you showed for all the world to see that Americans are sick of establishment-brand politics led by Republican hacks and Democrats In Name Only. This one is for the people, the 99%, as much as it’s for you.<br><br>So, where do you go from here? It’s up to you, but it’s not all good news. Those GOP sickos gerrymandered the House map two years ago, and it’s paid off for them as they’ve kept control of that chamber in spite of a national lean towards Democrats. You’ll have to work with the same smug faces that you’ve been trying to strongarm these past four years, as John Boehner will return for another term as Speaker. Hopefully, with enough pivots, you can push through some much-needed economic policy, but you have to be careful: if the next two years are all scandals and no wins, there’ll doubtlessly be another midterm mauling, and you’ll see out your later term as a lame duck.<br><br>But that’s for the fake news mainstream media to speculate about.

What a sham. A disgraceful sham. And you know exactly whose fault it is. The heartless corporate Republicans, and their fake news mainstream media puppets. The DINOs, the Occupy wackos. None of them could see your genius.

Economic well-being, the respect of her allies as a tough leader on the world stage, everything. Everything. Just like when the corporate-bought Supreme Court robbed Al Gore twelve years ago, the 1% has struck down the people’s champion in his prime, through the use of their happy cronies in Congress. Is it really over this time?.<br><br>That’s for you to decide. You know that bozo Chris Christie is going to screw up all your good work. There will be an appetite for change in 2016, just like there was when you were swept to victory four years ago. Will you stand at the fore of that noble tide?

You might like to think you can retain considerable influence in the post-Trump Democratic Party, but at this point, it’s not really for you to decide.
