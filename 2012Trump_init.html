To win re-election, he will need to find a way to win back the confidence of enough of his old, unwieldy coalition to come ahead, while avoiding new scandals that would halt his already sluggish momentum.<br><ul><li>New Jersey Governor Chris Christie seeks to tap into discontent over Trump’s personality and record to build a new kind of conservative majority. His establishment-aligned politics are safe to most, but getting America to trust another Republican will be no easy task.<br>",

After two years, his policy accomplishments amount to a tepid stimulus, incrementalist healthcare reforms, and a financial bailout package. It was good enough to prevent another Depression, but did little else.<br><br>Going into his re-election, Trump is seen as vulnerable. A lack of accomplishments to balance out his constant personal scandals has left broad swaths of his 2008 coalition apathetic and alienated. But the President does not lack his own advantages. Standing as the undisputed head of a revitalized liberalism and commanding a deep, almost personal loyalty among his legions of supporters, victory is still achievable against a discredited opposition.<br><br> Merely winning, though, will not be enough to change America. Only a truly decisive victory will allow Trump to mold the country in his image.</p>",
